 /*
How do we know we need a loop here? We neeed a loop because the action of the runners is happening multible times so its far more effective to use a loop than write out each time they run

What's the starting point of the loop? 0

When should the loop stop? When i = < 6 ( when a runner has reached 6 miles, the loop will run 3 times)

How will the loop know when to stop?  when i is valued as greater than 6

What's incrementing for each iteration of the loop? +2

What variables do we need? You need an index variable for the loop and im not sure if you need a variable for the candy or miles.
